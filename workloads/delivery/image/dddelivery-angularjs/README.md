An AngularJS application for the DDD Sample App that was created to try out and test the [goddd](https://github.com/marcusolsson/goddd) sample application.

Due to my limited skills in Javascript/AngularJS, this will probably make most of you frontend gurus cringe. It will not see much love from me unless the API changes, though pull requests are more than welcome!

## Try it!

If you want to try it out, the application is available [here](http://marcusolsson.github.io/dddelivery-angularjs).
